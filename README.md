# Hi, my name is Tomasz!!
#### Currently living in Malaga, Spain :es:.

##### About me:

Software Engineer with full stack experience building and maintaining production web applications.

I’m a graduate of Codespace Academy’s Full Stack Web Development program and have delivered end-to-end projects across frontend and backend systems. I code daily to continuously improve my technical depth and engineering best practices.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at BCXPro, contributing to scalable web applications in collaboration with cross-functional teams.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Caroda, where I integrated video players and advertising components into client applications and contributed to Node.js backend services and GraphQL APIs. Before that, I was part of Ciklum’s Data Acquisition team, developing crawlers for large-scale data extraction from e-commerce websites and Android applications.

Before transitioning into tech, I spent several years as a Senior Chef de Partie in high-pressure environments, building strong problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership skills that translate directly into software engineering.

Open to new projects and growth opportunities.
